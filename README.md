# BonR

This app utilizes JQuery, JS, HTML, CSS, a petfinder API and a google maps API. You can use this app to narrow down pets by the type you're interested, and your local zipcode in order to view local pets for adoption. With each animal you can either "match" or "swipe" on each animal, and look at more detailed information.
